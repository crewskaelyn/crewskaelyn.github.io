        <p>
            I am from a <em>very</em> small town with a population of about 250. I went to a K-12 school there for all
            13 years of primary schooling. I lived there with my mom, sister, and several dogs. Currently, we have 3
            dogs; 2 dachsunds and a boxer mix. You can find pictures of them <a href="photo.html">here.</a> My sister is
            currently a junior in high school. My mom is the CEO for a non-profit organization in Fayette, MO. Family is
            very important to us, and both sets of my
            grandparents live in town as well.
        </p>

            I am currently a sophomore at the University of Missouri. I completed all of my gen-eds while in high school
            through State Fair Community College. I used my first two semesters here at Mizzou to help me decide what I
            wanted to do for my degree. I decided upon a Bachelor in Information Technology and a minor in Psychology, and
            am about to enter my 3rd semester of it.
        </p>
        <p>My hobbies include:
            <ul>
                <li>Music</li>
                <li>Crafting</li>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <li>Art</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            So far in IT, I have done many projects. I have also participated in TigerHacks, where I created a website. My
            favorite languages right now are python, HTML, javascript, and CSS. I am very excited to learn new languages, and
            continue working towards my degree. I have not yet decided what I want to do with my career after graduation, but 
            I am considering software development or website development.
